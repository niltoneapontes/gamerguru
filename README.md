# Gamer Guru

## Introduction

This app uses IGDB API (https://api-docs.igdb.com/?swift#getting-started), which provides data for a variety of games for many platforms and genres. I created it to practice my knowledge of Swift and SwiftUI.

## Clone and Run on XCode

That's all you need to get started working with this code.

## Contributions

I'm open to contributions! Let's work on this together. :)
